Instructions
Runner.java runs the Percolation class and prints data about average probability and time taken. Click run and you will be asked to enter the N and the REPETITIONS the program is going to run. There will be a comment in main explaning how to only run specific algorithms at around line 45.

GRunner.java runs the Percolation class with graphics so it will be slower than normal. But the rest of the code is the exact same as Runner.java. Just run to start.

Percolation.java contains the Percolation class.

QuickFind.java, QuickUnion.java and WeightedQuickUnion.java contains the three standard UF algorithms.

UnionFindAlg.java, abstract class of QuickFind, QuickUnion, WeightedQuickUnion, and PathCompressionWQU.
