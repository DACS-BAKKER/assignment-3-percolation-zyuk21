Instructions
Runner.java runs the Percolation class and prints data about average probability and time taken. Can change private static final int N and private static final int REPITITIONS to your needs. There will be a comment in main explaning how to only run specific algorithms.

GRunner.java runs the Percolation class with graphics so it will be slower than normal. But the rest of the code is the exact same as Runner.java.

Percolation.java contains the Percolation class.

QuickFind.java, QuickUnion.java and WeightedQuickUnion.java contains the three UF algorithms.

UnionFindAlg.java, abstract class of QuickFind, QuickUnion, WeightedQuickUnion, and PathCompressionWQU.
